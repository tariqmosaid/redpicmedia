If you don&#8217;t, create a profile for your target audience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Are they mostly male or female? How old are they? Where are they from? What&#8217;s their job?<\/p>\r\n<p>The more detailed you are, the more information you can use to your advantage.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Keywords with targeting purpose<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>When a user makes a query, their intention will fall into these three categories:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Informatics.<br \/>Users want general information about a particular item or topic, so use keywords such as benefits, methods, and fact-guiding, aimed at educating the reader.<\/li>\r\n<li>Commercial.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Users who have a more serious business intention to make a purchase would start using keywords such as: specifications, expiration date, place of origin, shipping charges, etc. to provide clearer and specific information to the product.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Transactions<br \/>This is the last step before the user makes an order, at this stage, they compare products from multiple stores and try to get the best.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Use keywords such as: best price, sale, best quality, guaranteed, etc. to make them feel comfortable buying from you.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Free tools to search for a keyword for my website<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Free tools:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Google AdWords: Keyword Chart<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Being the most popular option, this free tool has been a favorite for many years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Google&#8217;s keyword chart is not only a good choice when you start a new website, but it can also be your best friend as you grow and produce more content.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see the basic benefit of this tool, so you can pull information directly from Google, the search engine you&#8217;re likely to target, when you improve your website.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Ubersuggest tool<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Are you heavily dependent on Google Keyword Planner?<\/p>\r\n<p>If so, expect this tool to provide you with all the keywords and data you need to make informed decisions.
